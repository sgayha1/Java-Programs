===============================================================================================================================

Overview: In this program, the user will input two player's names. After that, the program will run a while loop until either
Player 1 or 2 earns over 100 points. Player 1 starts and will only lose their turn if they roll a total of 12 or 2 for that 
round of their turn. Rolling a 2 is called 'snake eyes' and the player will lose their turn but their total will also go to 0. 
If a 12 is rolled, then the player will only lose their turn. The program will continue to go from player to player until one's 
score is greater than 100.
