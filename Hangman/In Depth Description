===============================================================================================================================

Overview: This program is an interpretation of the popular game 'Hangman.' An array of words that will be chosen from is 
instatiated first. Then, a word is chosen at random using Math.random times the length of the array to get an index value. Then 
that index value is used to pick a word in the array. A new array is created using chars, translating the String into a char
array. The user is asked for their name then welcomed with an explanation of the rules. Another char array is created, replacing
each char value with a -, simulating the hangman puzzle for the user to guess. A while loop then runs, giving the user 8 wrong
guesses until they lose the game. In the loop, the dashed array is displayed and the user is asked to guess a letter. The letter 
is added to an array list called used_letters. Then a for loop checks to see if the guesses letter is present anywhere in the 
chosen word. If it is present, the dash is changed to the letter and isTrue is changed to true, keeping track of if the user
guessed correctly. If not, isTrue is false and the user's count is incremented by 1, showing they guessed wrong. Then the 
guessed letters are displayed. Then it will check if the dashes array equals the wordtochar, meaning the user won. The loop 
continues to run until the user runs out of guesses or guesses the word correctly.
